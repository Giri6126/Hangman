Hangman AI Game 

Hey there 👋
This is my take on the classic Hangman game, but with a small twist — it’s powered by a bit of AI-style logic.
It’s simple, fun, and built entirely in Python.

🧠 What It Does?

The computer picks a random word, and your job is to guess it one letter at a time.
If you get a letter right, it shows up in the word. If not… well, you lose a life.
Pretty straightforward — but that’s what makes it fun.
I built this to show how AI reasoning (even at a basic level) can make games interactive and a little smarter.

✨ Features

Random word selection each time you play
Tracks correct and wrong guesses
Simple, text-based interface
Easy to understand, edit, and extend
Demonstrates basic rule-based decision-making

⚙️ How It Works

The program chooses a secret word.
You start guessing letters.
The computer checks your guess using simple if-else logic:
Correct guess → reveals the letter in its position.
Wrong guess → reduces your chances.
The game ends when you guess the full word or run out of tries.
It’s not fancy AI, but it’s a fun way to see how a computer “thinks” and reacts to your input.

🧩 Why I Made It

I wanted to make something that’s:
Quick to build 💡
Easy to understand for beginners
Still shows how logical AI decisions can make a game come alive
This project was a great way to combine simple Python programming with AI-style logic flow.

🚀 How to Run It

Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/Giri6126/hangman.git


Move into the folder:
cd hangman-ai-game


Run the game:
python hangman.py


That’s it — you’re ready to play!

🔮 Future Ideas

Add a GUI with buttons and visuals
Let the AI do the guessing next time 😏
Add difficulty levels and track player scores
Use letter frequency or NLP to make smarter guesses

I’m Girijan, a Computer Science student (AIML) who enjoys exploring how simple logic can make computers feel “smart.”
This project is just a small experiment that turned out to be more fun than expected.
